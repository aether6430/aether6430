# Hello, I'm Abhiram

## About Me

- A student who turns caffeine into code and wild ideas into working products.
- Specializing in **AI** (Google's models), **Next.js**, and **Arduino** - because why master one field when you can juggle three?
- Founder of **Avenire** - an AI startup revolutionizing education. Traditional learning platforms hate this one weird trick.

## Technical Arsenal

- **Next.js**: Creating web experiences so smooth, they make butter jealous.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Teaching machines to think, still working on teaching myself.
- **Arduino**: Hardware whisperer (success rate: surprisingly decent).
- **UI/UX Design**: Converting "how do I use this?" into "oh, that was obvious."
- **Natural Language Processing**: Making AI understand humans. Humans optional.
- **Machine Learning**: Teaching computers to learn from their mistakes, so I don't have to make them all myself.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Yes, I can center a div. No, I won't tell you how.
- **Startup Development**: Professional chaos coordinator.

## Current Mission

[![Avenire](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=aether6430&repo=Avenire)](https://github.com/aether6430/Avenire)

> **Avenire**: An AI-powered learning platform that's doing to education what Netflix did to Blockbuster. Minus the subscription fatigue.

## Behind the Screen

- Literature enthusiast - because sometimes the best code documentation is a good story.
- Koenigsegg aficionado - studying their engineering while my bank account studies humility.
- Tech optimist working to make the digital world a better place, one git commit at a time.
